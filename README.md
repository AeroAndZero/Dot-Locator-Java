# Dot Locator Java
Previously I Created A Project Named "Dot locator" in python (also in my Repositories), However I re-coded it in Java because it was the only possible way for me to Learn New Things In Java

## What Is Dot Locator ?
- Dot locator is a Software (currently CLI) which makes a 2d Graph depending on the Range you input.
- After When a Graph is made, You can add points and remove them on any value of x and y as long as its in the range.

## Difference Between Old Python Project and this one :
1) You can make a Graph of any Range
2) Graph Made By This Software Can Only Be in Square (eg. if x axis is from -15 to 15 then y axis will also be -15 to 15).
3) The "Print To Text File" Function Is Not Currently Available. Working On It.
4) You can Add and Remove Dots But Cannot Make A Line With Two Dots (also working on it).
